This is a Unity3d project that implements a variety of noise types in order to
generate a planet.

Instead of using the standard perlin function included in Unity, I've decided
to go with a C# implementation of the LibNoise library (http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/downloads/index.html)
in order to build my noise maps.

If you download a copy of this code, please note that all functionality is currently
in the editor. Actually playing the scene does nothing at the moment; but
you can generate textures from the inspector pane.

This repository is no longer current as this has been moved to a private repository.

Contact me if you want access!
